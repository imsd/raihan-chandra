Project 2 Proposal

	For our project we would like to create a projection mapped DJ launchpad. Our idea is to have 12 keys binded to a sound each, and every time a key is pressed a different colored light turns on. We would project it onto a box where we divide it into squares within the space.
	First of all we will be creating cube objects in unity where we attach our audio scripts. We then attach our desired mp3 files into the scripts. Afterwards we would add a camera for every object that we made and on each camera we attach the funnel script to them. This would allow it to communicate to the projection mapping application used in processing. Then we would proceed to map to our surface which is the ceiling in this case.
	The technical difficulties in this project mostly lie in making the audio scripts not continue playing after the key is let go. Also another difficulty is perfectly mapping our objects to the surfaces.
