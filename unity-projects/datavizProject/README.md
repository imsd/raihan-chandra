Raihan Chandra Dataviz project proposal

My idea is to create a data visualization on what characters are being picked in recent matches for the game League of Legends. There are around ~130 characters and each one of them will have their own objects that will increase/get bigger every time the that character is selected.

What I need to achieve it?
I will need to connect unity with the riot games api(found on develepor.riotgames.com) and grab the info of what characters are selected in recent matches

Which stats am I planning to use?
Characters selected during the most recent matches, how many matches are played during that timeframe.
